- 👋 Hi, I’m @nytelife
- 👀 I’m interested in beginning a journey as a tech profesional.  Thinking about data science but am still weighing options. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the best way to approach the learning.  I have tech background, but am out-of-date.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a place for beginners.  I'd rather have a fresh start and know a little more than set myself up for failure.
- 📫 How to reach me :Shout.  Loudly. (J/K i'll set something up TBD - rather not use personal email ATM)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I continue a paternal-side family tradition of rocking aloha shirts whenever possible.
